Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The code should create an app which cycles through 4 different yes or no questions pertaining to the symptoms of colds and allergies, providing a result based on answers to these questions. This assignment will teach me how to implement html, javascript, and css commands. I will also learn how to create pages and how to move from one to the next. Most complex will be creating a function to calculate and display the results of the fake diagnosis.
 
Known Issues:
Had trouble with the results because it was replacing the wrong portion of the code. After changing the name of the last page from results to end, the issue was resolved.

        var allergy_count = 0;
        var cold_count = 0;

	// The following two functions add a count to either the allergy or cold count, depending on the answer to a question. A tally of the count shows up as an alert after clicking each answer, yes or no.
        function allergyAdd(){
            allergy_count = allergy_count + 1;
		alert(allergy_count);

        }

        function coldAdd(){
            cold_count = cold_count + 1;
		alert(cold_count);
		//I added the alert for this one as there was no code for it before.
        }
	// 7) Next I had to write a function to calculate the probabilities of either cold or allergy. The math functions below give the respective allergy and cold percentages. The last variable should allow me to display the results on the results page.
	function probabilities(){
		var allergyPercent  = (allergy_count / 4) * 100;
		var coldPercent = (cold_count / 4) * 100;
		var resultText = document.getElementById("results");
		resultText.innerHTML = "Probability it is allergies = " + allergyPercent + "% <br> Probability it is a cold = " + coldPercent + "%";
		// 11) The line above was moved from the page to here in javascript so that it would actually be executed instead of simply displayed. Also by adding percent signs "%" The display looks better.
